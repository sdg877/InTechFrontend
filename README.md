<h1>IntechJobs</h1>
inTech is a full-stack web application developed as part of a team project using the MERN stack. Our goal was to create a platform where Junior Developers can search and apply for Entry-Level job postings. With a team of three developers, we completed the project within a timeframe of five days. My responsibilties included both the front end and back end.

<h1>Day 1</h1>

#### Brainstorming and Conceptualization

During the initial phase of the project, our team engaged in brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and outline the concept of IntechJobs. We utilized Excalidraw, a collaborative whiteboarding tool, to sketch out our ideas visually. This allowed us to visualize the project's structure, features, and user flow.

#### Excalidraw Sketches

I used Excalidraw to create sketches outlining the following aspects of IntechJobs:

- **User Interface Wireframes:** Rough sketches of the UI components, layouts, and navigation flow.
- **Database Schema:** Diagrams representing the structure of our MongoDB database, including collections, documents, and relationships.

#### Trello Board Setup

To streamline project management and task tracking, we established a Trello board. Trello provided us with a flexible and intuitive platform to organize our tasks, assign responsibilities, and track progress throughout the development cycle.

##### Trello Board Sections:

1. **To-Do:** This section contained a list of all tasks that needed to be completed.
2. **In Progress:** Tasks that were actively being worked on by team members.
3. **Review:** Completed tasks awaiting review by other team members.
4. **Done:** Tasks that were successfully completed and reviewed.

#### Backend Setup

Whilst teammates worked on creating pages and components in the frontend, I focused on setting up the backend infrastructure. This involved:

- Configuring the server using Node.js and Express.js.
- Implementing RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations for user authentication.

#### Git Collaboration

In addition to backend setup, I also spent time assisting team members with Git-related tasks such as creating branches, pulling changes, and resolving merge conflicts.

<h1>Day 2</h1>

On the second day of development, we focused on enhancing the security of our application and ensuring the backend functionality was robust. Additionally, we made progress in setting up the frontend environment by installing relevant dependencies.

## Backend Security

To improve the security of our application, I implemented bcrypt for password hashing and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication.

## Backend Testing

I tested the backend functionality by using Postman to send requests to the User endpoints. This allowed me to verify that the routes were properly configured and that I didn't mess things up!

## Frontend Dependencies

In parallel with backend security enhancements, we installed relevant dependencies on the frontend. These dependencies are essential for building the user interface and integrating with the backend API. By installing the necessary frontend libraries and tools, we prepared the frontend environment for further development.

## Next Steps

With backend security measures in place, backend functionality thoroughly tested, and frontend dependencies installed, we are ready to move forward with the implementation of core features and user interfaces. Day 2 was a productive day, laying the groundwork for the continued development of IntechJobs.

Stay tuned for more updates as we progress through the development journey!
