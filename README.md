<h1>IntechJobs</h1>
inTech is a full-stack web application developed as part of a team project using the MERN stack. Our goal was to create a platform where Junior Developers can search and apply for Entry-Level job postings. With a team of three developers, we completed the project within a timeframe of five days. My responsibilties included both the front end and back end.

<h1>Day 1: Planning</h1>

#### Brainstorming and Conceptualization

During the initial phase of the project, our team engaged in brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and outline the concept of IntechJobs. We utilized Excalidraw, a collaborative whiteboarding tool, to sketch out our ideas visually. This allowed us to visualize the project's structure, features, and user flow.

#### Excalidraw Sketches

I used Excalidraw to create sketches outlining the following aspects of IntechJobs:

- **User Interface Wireframes:** Rough sketches of the UI components, layouts, and navigation flow.
- **Database Schema:** Diagrams representing the structure of our MongoDB database, including collections, documents, and relationships.

#### Trello Board Setup

To streamline project management and task tracking, we established a Trello board. Trello provided us with a flexible and intuitive platform to organize our tasks, assign responsibilities, and track progress throughout the development cycle.

##### Trello Board Sections:

1. **To-Do:** This section contained a list of all tasks that needed to be completed.
2. **In Progress:** Tasks that were actively being worked on by team members.
3. **Review:** Completed tasks awaiting review by other team members.
4. **Done:** Tasks that were successfully completed and reviewed.

#### Backend Setup

Whilst teammates worked on creating pages and components in the frontend, I focused on setting up the backend infrastructure. This involved:

- Configuring the server using Node.js and Express.js.
- Implementing RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations for user authentication.

#### Git Collaboration

In addition to backend setup, I also spent time assisting team members with Git-related tasks such as creating branches, pulling changes, and resolving merge conflicts.
